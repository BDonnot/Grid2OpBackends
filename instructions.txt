when creating an envirinment

see: https://github.com/BDonnot/lightsim2grid
grid2op.make(..., backend=NewtonBackend)


import grid2op
from lightsim2grid import LightSimBackend
env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"  # or any other name.  -> this is sent to the backend `/home/whatehver/grid2op_datasets/l2rpn_case14_sandbox/grid.json`
env = grid2op.make(env_name, backend=LightSimBackend())

# do regular computation as you would with grid2op


from privateBackend import Backend
env = grid2op.make(env_name, backend=Backend(path_to_converted_grid=THE_PATH_WHERE_GRID_IS_CONVERTED))

path_to_converted_grid => l2rpn_case14_grid.xml, l2rpn_neurips_2020.xml etc. etc.
